# Analysis for Kickstarter Challenge 

## Overview of Project
The purpose od this analysis is to compare Plays across the world that have been successful or not based on their goals and campaign launch date.  We had a lot of data on different success outcomes and why they might have worked and didnâ€™t.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
I performed my analysis for this chart by creating a pivot table that filtered outcomes and the month the launch date.  I filtered the category to be Theater and Years to show which launch date ranges were most successful.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
I performed my analysis for this chart creating a column with the ranges of price goals for the campaign.  I used the data in the column to perform the COUNTIFS formula that calculated criteria for numbers associated with successful, failed and canceled campaigns.  I then used the SUM and AVG formulas to calculate the total projects and percentage of the successful, failed and canceled campaigns.   



- Conclusins about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date 
One of the conclusions we can draw from the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date datasheet is that Summer is your best chance to launch a successful campaign launch date.  From the chart we see that most plays that were successful occurred the most in the month of May.  The following months in June, July, and August had the next highest rate of successful outcomes with values of 100, 87, and 72.  Another conclusion we could draw from the chart is that the month of December is a month to avoid if possible.  From the chart we can see that December had the least number of successful outcomes along with approximately a %46 percent failed outcome rate in December

- Conclusion about Outcomes based on Goals
What we can conclude from the outcomes based on Goals datasheet is that if you keep your goal less than $40000 and above $30000, you have a good chance of having a successful play.  From the chart we can see from the ranges that $30K-$40K range had the highest successful percentage. 

- Summary of Limitations 
One of the limitations to this datasheet is the results from the canceled outcomes.  There is no definitive correlation between the why campaigns were cancelled opposed to just failing goal expectations.  It might be good to show a bar chart displaying the canceled outcomes and the goal amount and date for each of them.  There could be a correlation between how high the goal price is and canceled outcomes, a bar graph could easily show that due to the low amount of the canceled outcomes.   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
